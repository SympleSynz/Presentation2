###Introduction

- One of the things expressed in Foundations of Software Engineering is that software engineering is hard. Since the second day of lecture, the focus has been on the fact that there is no "silver bullet" to make software development improve by an order of magnitude. This doesn't mean that software engineering hasn't improved over the last decade, it just means there hasn't been a single method or tool to make a factor of ten improvement. What the industry has done instead, has continued to develop new software development methodologies and tools. Trello is such a tool that is meant to help with the software development life cyle. 

###Background

- "Trello is a free web-based project management application" [1]. The product Trello was originally created by Fog Creek Software in 2011 and recently became its own company, Trello, Inc, in 2014 [2]. Joel Spolsky, founder of Fog Creak Software, revealed Trello at TechCrunch Disrupt [3], which got the application named as one of "The 7 Coolest Startups You Haven't Heard of Yet" by Wired magazine September of 2011. LifeHacker stated that "it makes project collaboration simple and kind of enjoyable" [1]. 

- "Trello uses the kanban paradigm for managing projects, originally popularized by Toyota in the 1980s for supply chain management" [1]. Trello is not only web-based, but also has associated apps supported by iPhone, Android and Windows 8/10. The website version of Trello was designed to be accessible in most mobile web browsers, which gives users the ability to use either the app or their mobile web browsers on their phones or tablets. 

- The uses of Trello is found in a variety of fields, including work and personal uses. These fields include real estate management, software project management, school bulletin boards, etc [1].

- Even though the base functionalities of Trello are free, but a paid premium is offered for additional services. However, Trello Gold services can be obtained for free if the user invites more people to trello. Trello Gold allows for other background options, emoji, larger images, and many other attributes. 

###Trello Details

- As mentioned above, Trello uses the kanban paradigm. According to Wikipedia's Kanban page, Kanban is a Japanese word that literally translates to signboard or billboards. Kanban is a scheduling system that focuses on Lean manufacturing and Just-In-Time production methodologies [4]. Trello uses boards, lists and cards to organize tasks in an easy to read and understand format for project management. 

- **Boards** in Trello represent the overall project. A **Board** contains **Lists** which relate to a list of tasks that need to be completed. These **Lists** are made up of **Cards** that correspond to specific tasks. Each element of a Trello board is broken up into easily organized, easy to read subgroupings. Users that are collaborating on a project have their own personal accounts and share the board. Each user can then be assigned to specific tasks and make updates about the tasks for the rest of the team to be able to see. Users may also be removed or add at any time to any of the cards.  As cards are update and meet new requirements, they can moved to new lists across the board. Typically, the last list on the board is the completed list, so when cards are completed, they are moved to that list.

- Nearly everything on a Trello board can be customized, by adding additional lists, additional cards, removing any list or card when necessary and labeling based on the project requirements. Trello is initially web-based, but include an app supported on iPhone, Android and Windows 8/10 since 2014. The app will sync up with the web-based board for users that are on the go and not near their computers. Even with the app, users still have the option to also use the mobile web browsers.

- "Millions of people and companies of all kinds and sizes love using Trello" is stated on Trello's About page indicating that Freshdirect, The New York Times, 53, The Verge, Adobe, tumblr., Google, PayPal, and Kickstarter all use Trello to complete projects [3].

###Conclusion

- Since a single "silver bullet" is not a viable solution for software development, creating tools and methodologies to reduce the work load and increase efficiency of software development in small parts is the next approach. As computers and mobile devices become more integrated with every day life, software development appears to be increasing as well. Trello, Rally, Agile methodologies and more continue to be created to help make software development faster and more efficient. Trello is a light-weight project management tool that coordinates with the "On-The-Go" pace of today's society.
